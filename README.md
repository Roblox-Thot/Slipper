> [!WARNING]\
> This will not make any "amazing" bypasses for you, you will have to make them yourself. This just makes the images with different hashes.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> You need some form of PIL (Python Image Library) installed for this to work if you are using the source code and not the Exe in releases

> [!NOTE]\
> If you want to mass upload use a decal uploader like [DecalUploaderV2](https://github.com/Roblox-Thot/DecalUploaderV2)

# Methods
Alpha
> Makes images with alphas from 150 to 250

Random color
> Makes images with one random pixel set to a random color

Static
> Adds a static overlay to the image with the given transparency
 
Transparent static
> Makes static using the transparency

Remove "shadows"
> This is a shitty method that removes the black parts of the image (to put image on black stuff like torso)

Remove "highlights"
> This is a shitty method that removes the white parts of the image (to put image on white stuff like torso)
